        #### Sample JSON Response:

        ```
            [
                {
                    "id": 11,
                    "category_id": 15,
                    "name": "Baseball Cap",
                    "price": 24.99,
                    "stock": 43,
                    "description": "Classic baseball cap with adjustable strap.",
                    "created_at": "2025-10-04T18:26:14.000000Z",
                    "updated_at": "2025-10-05T02:02:12.000000Z",
                    "category": {
                    "id": 15,
                    "name": "hat",
                    "created_at": "2025-10-04T18:26:14.000000Z",
                    "updated_at": "2025-10-04T18:26:14.000000Z"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "id": 13,
                    "category_id": 16,
                    "name": "Cotton T-Shirt",
                    "price": 29.99,
                    "stock": 100,
                    "description": "100% cotton t-shirt, available in multiple colors.",
                    "created_at": "2025-10-04T18:26:14.000000Z",
                    "updated_at": "2025-10-04T18:26:14.000000Z",
                    "category": {
                    "id": 16,
                    "name": "shirt",
                    "created_at": "2025-10-04T18:26:14.000000Z",
                    "updated_at": "2025-10-04T18:26:14.000000Z"
                    }
                }
            ]
        ```


    2. POST â€“ /api/orders

    - Creates a new order for the authenticated customer.

    - Since the app uses session-based Laravel Breeze authentication, the API cannot be tested directly via Postman.

    - Instead, use Laravel Tinker to simulate the request and view the JSON response.

    #### Steps:
    
    1. Start tinker
        ```
        php artisan tinker
        ```

    2. Run these commands inside Tinker:

        ```
            $user = App\Models\User::where('role', 'customer')->first();
            Auth::login($user);
            
            $products = App\Models\Product::limit(2)->get();

            echo "Available Products:\n";
            foreach ($products as $product) {
                echo "ID: {$product->id}, Name: {$product->name}, Price: {$product->price}, Stock: {$product->stock}\n";
            }

            $orderData = [
                'items' => [
                    ['product_id' => $products[0]->id, 'quantity' => 2],
                    ['product_id' => $products[1]->id, 'quantity' => 1],
                ],
                'shipping_phone' => '+254712345678'
            ];

            $request = new Illuminate\Http\Request($orderData);
            $controller = new App\Http\Controllers\Api\OrderApiController();
            $response = $controller->store($request);

            echo "\n=== API RESPONSE ===\n";
            echo "Status Code: " . $response->getStatusCode() . "\n";
            echo "Response Content: "  .  $response->getContent() . "\n";
        ```

    ### Expected Output:

        ```
            === API RESPONSE ===
            Status Code: 201
            Response Content: {"message":"Order created","order_id":13,"total":69.97}
        ```
